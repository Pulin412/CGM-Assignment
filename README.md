## CGM-Assignment
A Java 8 command line program that gives two options. One to ask a specific question and the other option is to add questions and their answers

### About
- Technologies used : Java, Hibernate, JUnit5
- Database : Embedded File based H2 database

### Assumptions
- Spring framework is not used to keep the generated jar file as thin as possible and as there are very few dependencies involved but Spring can be used in future expansion if needed.
- We can also use JDBC instead of Hibernate for database connection and give interfaces for multiple databases connection to avoid any code change in future if the database is changed.
- Interfaces are used for service and dao to allow extendability to the solution, in case some other implementations are proposed in future.
- Some messages are returned from the solution to be shown on the console, are placed in Constants file, for better visibility and modifications, if needed.

### Response Messages
- If the user asks a question which is not stored yet in the program, “the answer to life, universe and everything is 42” is printed.
- If the user asks a question which is  stored in the program, all answers to that question are printed in a separate line.
- If a question, which is already saved, is tried to save in the program with same/different answers, exception with message - "Question is already present." is thrown and question is discarded.
- If any question with invalid format (without '?') or as null is passed to the program, exception with messages - "Question format is incorrect" , "Question is invalid" is thrown.
- Correct format for question - 
    `<question>? “<answer1>” “<answer2>” “<answerX>”`

### Running the application

### Maven

```

```bash
$mvn -v

```
 
#### Run the application with arguments - 
Pass the arguments in " " with inner multiple arguments in ' ' - 

```bash
mvn exec:java -Dexec.args="'What is Peters favorite food?' 'Pizza' 'Spaghetti' 'Ice cream'"
``` 
To exit the application, press **ctrl-c**.
